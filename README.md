Bookscraper app to be able to scrape https://books.toscrape.com/ and download all kind of files,images etc.

Creating a tree structure to symbolize how it looked on the page which will also let you go through the whole page locally after  the application is completed.

Sadly I have not yet looked into async functionality so I would suggest you to go grab a coffee or something while the application is running, I believe it takes about 10-12 minutes to complete at the moment

## To Run
Navigate into BookScrapingApp/BookScrapingApp and run `dotnet run`

## Reference materials
Since this is my first project in C# I've tried to gather information regarding a similar project

https://www.zenrows.com/blog/web-scraping-c-sharp - I've used this one to get the feeling on how the webscraping works

https://stackify.com/c-threading-and-multithreading-a-guide-with-examples/ - I've read this one to get a feeling about how threading/async etc works in C#, I've not had the time to implement it though
