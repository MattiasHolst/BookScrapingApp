Bookscraper app to be able to scrape https://books.toscrape.com/ and download all kind of files,images etc.

Creating a tree structure to symbolize how it looked on the page which will also let you go through the whole page locally after  the application is completed.

Sadly I have not yet looked into async functionality so I would suggest you to go grab a coffee or something while the application is running, I believe it takes about 10-12 minutes to complete at the moment

## To Run
Navigate into BookScrapingApp/BookScrapingApp and run `dotnet run`
